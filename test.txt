00:04 - 00:08[END]
This is a top-down isometric style shooter game[END]
00:08 - 00:10[END]
You are a boy who is[END]
00:10 - 00:13[END]
having a dream that all of his toys have come to life.[END]
00:14 - 00:18[END]
You run around, you shoot zombie teddies and other things,[END]
00:19 - 00:23[END]
score points and eventually meet your demise.[END]
00:24 - 00:25[END]
So that's what we're going to make[END]
00:25 - 00:29[END]
and we're going to be learning about the editor[END]
00:29 - 00:31[END]
from putting together a scene[END]
00:31 - 00:34[END]
implementing animated characters, AI,[END]
00:35 - 00:39[END]
some of the new UI and lots of other stuff.[END]
00:39 - 00:40[END]
It's a very uplifting game,[END]
00:40 - 00:42[END]
you can't win, you can only eventually lose.[END]
00:42 - 00:45[END]
So that's the way we prefer to make them.[END]
00:45 - 00:49[END]
The very first thing you'll notice is that on my screen[END]
00:49 - 00:52[END]
I have the project open.[END]
00:52 - 00:54[END]
We don't want you to have the project open[END]
00:54 - 00:56[END]
at all, what we want you to do is to[END]
00:56 - 00:58[END]
make your own new scene and we're going to[END]
00:58 - 00:59[END]
put this project together.[END]
00:59 - 01:02[END]
So if anyone has got the scene open[END]
01:02 - 01:04[END]
we don't want you to do that, we want you to make[END]
01:04 - 01:06[END]
a brand new scene.[END]
01:06 - 01:08[END]
So first of all we're going to go to File - New Scene.[END]
01:08 - 01:10[END]
Then what we want you guys to do, to make sure that[END]
01:10 - 01:12[END]
everyone's kind of on the same page we're going to ask[END]
01:12 - 01:14[END]
you to setup the editor in the same[END]
01:14 - 01:16[END]
style that we have.[END]
01:16 - 01:18[END]
If you're comfortable with Unity, if you've used Unity before[END]
01:18 - 01:20[END]
and you prefer to work in your layout[END]
01:20 - 01:23[END]
of the editor that's totally cool, you can keep that.[END]
01:23 - 01:25[END]
But if you're new to Unity what we'd like you to do[END]
01:25 - 01:28[END]
is to choose the layout menu in the upper right[END]
01:29 - 01:31[END]
and choose 2 by 3.[END]
01:32 - 01:35[END]
So layout drop down in the upper right and choose 2 by 3.[END]
01:35 - 01:38[END]
That would get you a style that gets you something like this.[END]
01:38 - 01:41[END]
Then what we'd like you to do is to drag the project panel[END]
01:41 - 01:43[END]
and drop it below the hierarchy.[END]
01:43 - 01:45[END]
You'll note that when you drag the title tabs[END]
01:45 - 01:47[END]
of the panels around they will dock[END]
01:47 - 01:48[END]
in to different spaces.[END]
01:48 - 01:50[END]
Drop that below the hierarchy[END]
01:50 - 01:53[END]
and then you can just drag up the division between those two,[END]
01:53 - 01:55[END]
maybe drag this over a little[END]
01:55 - 01:57[END]
and then you should be all set.[END]
01:57 - 01:59[END]
So hopefully everyone's got a view like that?[END]
01:59 - 02:01[END]
Then what I usually like to do is[END]
02:01 - 02:03[END]
with the project panel, because we don't really need[END]
02:03 - 02:06[END]
to use the thumbnails particularly[END]
02:06 - 02:08[END]
there's a slider at the bottom[END]
02:08 - 02:10[END]
which will change to list view when dragged[END]
02:10 - 02:12[END]
all the way over to the left.[END]
02:13 - 02:15[END]
So if we drag it over to the left you're going to see[END]
02:15 - 02:17[END]
exactly the same as what I have[END]
02:17 - 02:19[END]
on my screen here.[END]
02:19 - 02:22[END]
We are working with Unity 4.6[END]
02:22 - 02:23[END]
but right now what we'd like you to do is to go to[END]
02:23 - 02:25[END]
File - Save Scene As[END]
02:25 - 02:27[END]
and we will ask you to put this in[END]
02:27 - 02:29[END]
to the Scenes folder.[END]
02:29 - 02:31[END]
We don't want you to use the completed[END]
02:31 - 02:33[END]
assets version of anything[END]
02:33 - 02:35[END]
just use the[END]
02:35 - 02:37[END]
Scenes folder that's in the[END]
02:37 - 02:39[END]
root of the project.[END]
02:39 - 02:42[END]
And we're going to call this Level 01.[END]
02:44 - 02:47[END]
So save it as Level 01 in the Scenes folder.[END]
02:49 - 02:51[END]
When you've done that successfully you should see the name of[END]
02:51 - 02:54[END]
your scene up at the top of the interface.[END]
02:54 - 02:56[END]
Okay so the next thing we're going to do is[END]
02:56 - 02:59[END]
setup the environment, so I'm just going to show you that first.[END]
03:00 - 03:02[END]
So a prefab, just to reiterate[END]
03:02 - 03:04[END]
how this stuff works, a prefab is our way of[END]
03:04 - 03:07[END]
providing or saving a game object[END]
03:07 - 03:08[END]
in to the project.[END]
03:08 - 03:10[END]
You can do that for a number of different reasons[END]
03:10 - 03:13[END]
and we'll be saving prefabs in order to[END]
03:13 - 03:15[END]
spawn them in to the game later with the enemies.[END]
03:15 - 03:17[END]
But for the purpose of the environment[END]
03:17 - 03:19[END]
we prepared the model[END]
03:19 - 03:22[END]
and a number of collider and other elements.[END]
03:22 - 03:24[END]
If you look in the prefabs folder you will[END]
03:24 - 03:26[END]
find a prefab called environment.[END]
03:26 - 03:29[END]
Prefabs are represented by this blue cube icon.[END]
03:30 - 03:32[END]
All you need to do is to drag and drop that up[END]
03:32 - 03:34[END]
in to the hierarchy.[END]
03:34 - 03:36[END]
So just to remind you, the hierarchy and the scene[END]
03:36 - 03:40[END]
are intrinsically linked, anything that's in the scene[END]
03:40 - 03:43[END]
is therefore in the hierarchy and visa versa.[END]
03:44 - 03:47[END]
Just make sure that you've got a decent view of this level.[END]
03:47 - 03:48[END]
You can use the hand tool of course[END]
03:48 - 03:50[END]
up in the upper left[END]
03:50 - 03:52[END]
and use Control to zoom in and out[END]
03:52 - 03:55[END]
and Alt to rotate around.[END]
03:55 - 03:57[END]
We don't need to worry too much about the view[END]
03:57 - 03:59[END]
that you're looking at in the scene view[END]
03:59 - 04:01[END]
because we're going to setup the camera to look at[END]
04:01 - 04:02[END]
particular part of that later.[END]
04:02 - 04:04[END]
What we're just going to check is that we[END]
04:04 - 04:07[END]
positioned the environment at the origin.[END]
04:07 - 04:09[END]
So with the environment selected in the transform[END]
04:09 - 04:11[END]
component you should see the position is at[END]
04:11 - 04:13[END]
(0, 0, 0).[END]
04:13 - 04:16[END]
If it's not just fill that in, (0, 0, 0)[END]
04:16 - 04:18[END]
or go to the cog icon in the[END]
04:18 - 04:21[END]
upper right and choose Reset Position.[END]
04:22 - 04:24[END]
Then once we've done that we are also going to drag[END]
04:24 - 04:27[END]
in the Lights prefab.[END]
04:27 - 04:30[END]
Lights is in the prefabs folder,[END]
04:30 - 04:32[END]
you simply need to drag that in to[END]
04:32 - 04:35[END]
the scene and it should light your scene.[END]
04:35 - 04:37[END]
With the lights we don't need to worry about[END]
04:37 - 04:40[END]
positioning particularly because it's directional lights.[END]
04:40 - 04:43[END]
With directional lights you only need to worry about the rotation.[END]
04:43 - 04:45[END]
So if I just show you those briefly you can see that these[END]
04:45 - 04:47[END]
directional lights are pointing in[END]
04:47 - 04:50[END]
certain rotations and they're going to affect[END]
04:50 - 04:52[END]
anything in the scene, you don't need to worry about[END]
04:52 - 04:54[END]
where they're positioned.[END]
04:54 - 04:56[END]
The way this game is going to work is[END]
04:56 - 04:58[END]
we're going to have a camera that's[END]
04:58 - 05:00[END]
looking down on the scene.[END]
05:00 - 05:02[END]
And what we need to do in order to track[END]
05:02 - 05:04[END]
the player around and also to be able to[END]
05:04 - 05:06[END]
shoot is to use something called[END]
05:06 - 05:08[END]
a ray cast which is going to create an[END]
05:08 - 05:11[END]
invisible line from the camera to the floor.[END]
05:11 - 05:13[END]
But we've got a very inconsistent floor,[END]
05:13 - 05:16[END]
we've got a number of different environment objects[END]
05:16 - 05:19[END]
such as these stools, the Lego bricks,[END]
05:19 - 05:21[END]
the broken train[END]
05:21 - 05:24[END]
and all these different things, so we don't want to worry about[END]
05:24 - 05:26[END]
ray casting on to those at different heights[END]
05:26 - 05:28[END]
so to make things a lot simpler[END]
05:28 - 05:30[END]
what we're doing is we're going to add[END]
05:30 - 05:32[END]
in a plane quad.[END]
05:32 - 05:34[END]
So what I'd like you guys to do is to go to Game Object[END]
05:34 - 05:37[END]
3D Object and Quad.[END]
05:40 - 05:42[END]
What you'll notice is this creates a very small[END]
05:42 - 05:45[END]
1 by 1 quad right in the centre[END]
05:45 - 05:47[END]
of your game.[END]
05:47 - 05:50[END]
We're going to reset that to (0,0,0)[END]
05:51 - 05:53[END]
in the transform component[END]
05:53 - 05:56[END]
so make sure the position of your quad is at 0.[END]
05:59 - 06:01[END]
And we're going to rotate it by[END]
06:01 - 06:03[END]
90 degrees in the X axis.[END]
06:05 - 06:07[END]
Finally we want this to cover the entire[END]
06:07 - 06:09[END]
game level so we're going to[END]
06:09 - 06:11[END]
scale this by 100 in X[END]
06:11 - 06:13[END]
and 100 in Y.[END]
06:13 - 06:15[END]
We're going to name this Floor.[END]
06:16 - 06:19[END]
So rename from quad[END]
06:20 - 06:21[END]
to Floor.[END]
06:22 - 06:24[END]
So the next thing we're going to do is[END]
06:24 - 06:26[END]
to make this invisible, obviously you'll notice that it looks[END]
06:26 - 06:28[END]
pretty horrendous right now.[END]
06:28 - 06:30[END]
We don't want to actually see this.[END]
06:30 - 06:32[END]
What we want to do is use the collider,[END]
06:32 - 06:34[END]
so the outline of this shape.[END]
06:34 - 06:38[END]
We don't want to use this kind of grey for any reason at all.[END]
06:38 - 06:40[END]
So a quad is made visible by the[END]
06:40 - 06:42[END]
mesh renderer component,[END]
06:42 - 06:44[END]
and because we don't want that we're just going to[END]
06:44 - 06:47[END]
go ahead and remove it so with the floor selected[END]
06:48 - 06:50[END]
click the cog to the right of the mesh renderer[END]
06:50 - 06:52[END]
and choose Remove Component.[END]
06:53 - 06:55[END]
So with your floor selected go to[END]
06:55 - 06:57[END]
the cog icon in the upper right and choose[END]
06:57 - 06:59[END]
Remove Component and you should see[END]
06:59 - 07:02[END]
that you can then only see the collider outline.[END]
07:02 - 07:04[END]
Make sure you remove the mesh renderer,[END]
07:04 - 07:07[END]
not the mesh filter or the mesh collider.[END]
07:07 - 07:11[END]
Remember you've got Undo if anything goes horrendously wrong[END]
07:11 - 07:14[END]
but you should then see that you just have the collider around[END]
07:14 - 07:16[END]
the outline of the level, something like that.[END]
07:17 - 07:19[END]
Then because we don't want[END]
07:19 - 07:21[END]
our ray cast to check for anything[END]
07:21 - 07:24[END]
but this quad we're going to use layers.[END]
07:24 - 07:26[END]
so a layer is a way of isolating[END]
07:26 - 07:30[END]
things like ray casting or lighting for example,[END]
07:30 - 07:32[END]
to a particular group.[END]
07:32 - 07:34[END]
So with the floor selected[END]
07:34 - 07:36[END]
if you click the Layer drop down you should see[END]
07:36 - 07:40[END]
that we have a floor layer ready for you.[END]
07:40 - 07:42[END]
Choose from the Layer drop down at the top of the[END]
07:42 - 07:44[END]
the inspector, Floor.[END]
07:46 - 07:48[END]
And then save your scene.[END]
07:48 - 07:50[END]
The next thing we're going to do is finish off[END]
07:50 - 07:54[END]
our environment by adding some background music.[END]
07:54 - 07:56[END]
With sound sources in Unity we can attach[END]
07:56 - 07:58[END]
them to any object, it's a component that you[END]
07:58 - 08:00[END]
use to apply a clip to or you[END]
08:00 - 08:03[END]
use scripting to assign clips to.[END]
08:03 - 08:05[END]
We are going to have a separate game[END]
08:05 - 08:07[END]
object just to keep things separate and just to[END]
08:07 - 08:08[END]
keep them nicely organised.[END]
08:08 - 08:11[END]
So I'd like you to go to Game Object - Create Empty[END]
08:13 - 08:15[END]
and then rename this Background Music.[END]
08:17 - 08:19[END]
Return on the Mac or F2 on the PC[END]
08:19 - 08:21[END]
just like your operating system[END]
08:21 - 08:23[END]
and rename this Background Music[END]
08:23 - 08:27[END]
So we're creating an empty and renaming it Background Music.[END]
08:27 - 08:30[END]
Then we can add components to our game objects[END]
08:30 - 08:32[END]
to make them do different things.[END]
08:32 - 08:35[END]
So we have a component menu up at the top[END]
08:35 - 08:37[END]
with a bunch of different categories of things[END]
08:37 - 08:39[END]
that you can do to your game object to give it different[END]
08:39 - 08:42[END]
behaviour of different functionality.[END]
08:42 - 08:44[END]
What we're going to add is an audio source[END]
08:44 - 08:46[END]
so we can use this component menu[END]
08:46 - 08:49[END]
or we can use the Add Component menu[END]
08:49 - 08:51[END]
over on the right in the inspector.[END]
08:51 - 08:53[END]
So because the inspector will show you properties of the[END]
08:53 - 08:56[END]
game object currently selected we can[END]
08:56 - 08:58[END]
go in to here and we want to add an Audio[END]
08:58 - 09:00[END]
Audio Source[END]
09:01 - 09:04[END]
We don't really want to hear the music[END]
09:04 - 09:06[END]
for this game playing[END]
09:06 - 09:08[END]
every time you press play in your game[END]
09:08 - 09:11[END]
but just to make sure that everyone's worked[END]
09:11 - 09:13[END]
we are going to do it once.[END]
09:13 - 09:15[END]
So to assign a audio clip[END]
09:15 - 09:18[END]
to the audio source we can use the circle select.[END]
09:18 - 09:20[END]
We're going to refer to circle select a lot throughout[END]
09:20 - 09:24[END]
the day, it's the small nipple-like icon[END]
09:24 - 09:27[END]
to the right of the audio clip, and what that will do is pop up[END]
09:27 - 09:29[END]
a context window which is going to allow you to[END]
09:29 - 09:31[END]
find the file you need.[END]
09:31 - 09:33[END]
The file you need is Background Music,[END]
09:33 - 09:37[END]
surprisingly enough, and simply closing that window[END]
09:37 - 09:39[END]
will assign it to that.[END]
09:39 - 09:43[END]
For everyone's sanity uncheck Play On Awake.[END]
09:43 - 09:45[END]
We also want the music to loop when we are finished[END]
09:45 - 09:48[END]
with the game, we do want it to loop[END]
09:48 - 09:51[END]
so uncheck Play On Awake and check Loop.[END]
09:51 - 09:54[END]
In the volume in the component there is a slider.[END]
09:55 - 09:58[END]
And we can just drag that down to about 0.1.[END]
09:58 - 10:00[END]
So that's just to balance it with the other sound effects[END]
10:00 - 10:02[END]
we have in the game, and then you can go ahead and[END]
10:02 - 10:04[END]
save your scene once more.[END]
10:04 - 10:07[END]
That's the end of phase one, setting up the environment.[END]
10:07 - 10:10[END]
The next thing we're going to do is look at our player character.
